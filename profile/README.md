## Hi there 👋

## I'm David Gold...

### What is this organization all about...

#### Lets Begin!!

<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

<!-- ### 🍿 An interconnected community

The open source community is the 💗 heart of GitHub and fundamental to how we build software today. See for yourself:

- [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors) helped support more than **5k** individuals and projects around the world 🌍
- Open source projects on GitHub received a stunning **218 million** contributions 🚀 in the last year alone
- **Every minute** a developer creates a new release 🏄 for a public project on GitHub
 -->
Now that we are talking about the important things ☝️, are you contributing to open source? Yes? Okay, you rock! 🎸 If not, we can help you get started! Open source software is made by people just like you. Learn more about [how to contribute](https://opensource.guide/).

### 🦦 Contributing to the ecosystem

We contribute to the tools 🔧 we rely on to build and run GitHub, while also maintaining 🧙‍♂️ our own open source projects like:

- [GitHub CLI](https://github.com/cli/cli) - A command line tool for GitHub
- [Git Large File Storage](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs) - A git extension for versioning large files
- [Primer](https://github.com/primer/css) - The GitHub design system

### 👓 Appendix

See what's next on our [public roadmap](https://github.com/github/roadmap) ✨ and [let us know](https://github.com/github/feedback) if you have any suggestions 🙇‍♂️. Oh, and by the way, we are always hiring talented, passionate people to [join our team](https://github.com/about/careers) 🙌.
